Archibald is supposed to be a community developed installer for Arch linux.
Anyone who are familiar with perl can participate by adding features, fixing bugs
or maybe refactoring existing code.

The basic idea is that the archibald installer should generate a bash installer script.
This makes it relatively easy to work with as you can develope the software on pretty
much any computer and manually inspect the generated bash installer without going
through the process of testing it in virtualbox, or whatever, every time a change has been made.
Work on the generated bash script until it looks promising, then give it a test.

Another reason for generating a standalone installer is that it may come in handy if you are
a system administrator and you need to install Arch on several computers simultanously.
Having a pre-generated installer should make this process quick and easy.

As of this writing I have no other rule than this:
Take responsibility for you own code, and comment it so that others can follow along.

The structure of the code is as follows:

setup:
This is a bash file responsible for checking root access and installing any prerequisites,
like the perl curses module. After that it fires off archibald.pl

archibald.pl:
This perl script sets up some environment before it launches the run function in UI.pl

UI.pl:
Contains the driver function "run", which sets up the entire UI and then goes into a
curses event loop.

Callbacks.pl:
This file contains all the callback routines referenced in UI.pl
Along with UI.pl this file is contians the meat of the application.

Functions.pl:
This file contains helper functions used in Callback.pl

Common.pl:
This file contains global variables shared among the other files.

And thats about it. A pretty basic setup.
