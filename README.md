Archibald - A community developed installer for Arch linux

====================================================

This software is currently in alfa state.

Using this installer will create a GPT disk using the grub2 bootloader, installing arch either on the entire disk or alongside an existing OS.

To start the installation process, issue the following commands on a fresh archlinux installation image:
<pre>
# curl https://raw.github.com/corebob/archibald/master/kickstart > kickstart
# bash kickstart
</pre>
Check out the file HACKING if you consider getting involved.
