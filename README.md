Archibald - A community developed installer for Arch linux

====================================================

This software is still in early development.

If you wan't to try it, you should be able to do so by issuing the following commands on
a fresh Arch live media with a working network connection:
<pre>
# wget https://raw.github.com/corebob/archibald/master/kickstart
# bash kickstart
</pre>


Alternatively, you can download the source using git, or wget https://github.com/corebob/archibald/tarball/master,
and then run the file 'setup'



Don't expect too much just yet. Check out the file 'TODO' to see what does _not_ work yet.
Also, check out the file HACKING if you consider getting involved.
